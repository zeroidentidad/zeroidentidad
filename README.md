### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Bachelor of Computer Systems, essentially dedicated to web and mobile programming with JS/ES6+. Looking to delve into Golang and be FullStack with React/React Native, studying topics related to modern web development.

Saving experiences in blogs, repos, gists, groups, chat servers, online courses, in mind and heart... because the computer can die and it has happened to me :(
